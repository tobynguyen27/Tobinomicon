## Overview

Wallsharing is a behavior of virtually all Astral Generators multiblocks that allows them to have one or more walls in common with another multiblock of the same or even a different type. This can be used to parallelize production lines, economize on space or save construction resources.

To wallshare, two or more machine controllers need to be placed in such a way that all the shared blocks are in legal locations for all conjoined multiblocks. Wallsharing is not a unique feature that needs to be explicitly enabled; it will always work where physically possible as a controller only cares about the blocks within its defined limits, not what's adjacent or built nearby. As long as the structure of each multi individually is correct, it will continue working as if nothing else around it existed.

## Limitations

Only non-port blocks are allows to be shared.
