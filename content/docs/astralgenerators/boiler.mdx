## Overview

The Boiler is a multiblock used to generate steam by burning fuel to heat up water.

## Construction

### Materials

- Boiler Casings

### Ports

- Item Input Bus: For fuel.
- Fluid Input Hatch: For water.
- Fluid Output Hatch: For steam.

<Callout title="Attention" type="warning">
    Ports block must be in the same layer with the Boiler controller.
</Callout>

### Building

<Callout title="Wallsharing" type="idea">
    Boiler can do wallsharing

Using a [Multiblock Projector](./projector.mdx) will help you building the Boiler easily.

## Operation

### Fueling

Supply fuel (Coal, Logs, Planks) to the Item Input Bus:

- Coal burns for 1600 ticks.
- Logs burn for 800 ticks.
- Planks burn for 400 ticks.

### Heating

As fuel burns, the boiler's temperature increases. Steam production begins once the temperature reaches the boiling point (default: 100 Celsius degree).

### Output

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
    Water consumption scales with current heat vs max heat.
</Callout>

Steam is produced in the Output Hatch based on the expansion ratio.
