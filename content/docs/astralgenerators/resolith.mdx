## Overview

**Resolith** <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(from "Resonant Lithos")</span> is a wireless energy network designed to transfer energy seamlessly between machines without the clutter of physical cables.

## Components

### Resolith Transceiver

The **Resolith Transceiver** is the primary interface of the network. It handles the input and output of energy, serving as the bridge between your machines and the network.

By default, transceiver is in `Import` mode aka `Send energy to network`. You can toggle it to `Export` mode by `Shift + Right CLick` with an empty hand.

### Resolith Relay

Transceivers have a connection limit. To expand your network over large distances or connect multiple clusters of machines, you will need the **Resolith Relay**.

Relays act as signal repeaters. They can connect to Transceivers or other Relays, allowing for theoretically infinite range and scalability.

    While the network logic is optimized, building massive networks with excessive connections may still impact server performance (TPS). Plan your routing efficiently!

### Resolith Manipulator

The **Resolith Manipulator** is the essential handheld tool required to build and manage your network. It allows you to link nodes (Transceivers and Relays) together.

**Controls:**

- **Select Source:** `Shift + Right Click` on a node to select it (starts a connection).
- **Connect Target:** `Right Click` on a second node to complete the connection.
- **Clear Selection:** `Shift + Right Click` in the air to cancel your current selection.
