title: Steam Turbine
description: A multiblock that produces energy from steam
---

## Overview

The Steam Turbine is a complex multiblock generator that consumes steam to spin a rotor, generating energy (E) and producing water as a byproduct.

## Construction

### Materials

- Steam Turbine Casing
- Pipe Casing
- Steam Turbine Vent
- Steam Turbine Controller

### Ports

- Fluid Input Hatch: For steam.
- Fluid Output Hatch: For water (byproduct).
- Energy Output Hatch: For generated power.

<Callout title="Attention" type="warning">
    Ports block must be in the same layer with the Steam Turbine controller.
</Callout>

### Building

Using a [Multiblock Projector](./projector.mdx) will help you building the Steam Turbine easily.

## Operation

### Mechanics

- The turbine consumes steam in the fluid input hatch to spin up the rotor.
- Rotor Speed increases based on steam consumption and the Accelerator Factor.
- The rotor naturally slows down over time due to friction (Drag Coefficient).

### Output

- Energy generated based on the current Rotor Speed multiplied by the Energy Multiplier.
- Condensed steam is output as water. It produces water constantly while spinning, even if not currently consuming steam (dependent on rotor speed > 0).
