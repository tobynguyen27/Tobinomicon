## Overview

The Steam Turbine is a complex multiblock generator that consumes steam to spin a rotor, generating energy (E) and producing water as a byproduct.

## Construction

### Materials

- Steam Turbine Casing
- Pipe Casing
- Steam Turbine Vent
- Steam Turbine Controller

### Ports

- Fluid Input Hatch: For steam.
- Fluid Output Hatch: For water (byproduct).
- Energy Output Hatch: For generated power.

### Building

Using a [Multiblock Projector](./projector.mdx) will help you building the Steam Turbine easily.

<Callout title="Wallsharing" type="idea">
    To wallshare, two or more machine controllers need to be placed in such a way that all the
    shared blocks are in legal locations for all conjoined multiblocks.
