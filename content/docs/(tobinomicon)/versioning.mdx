## Overview

To maintain clean version strings, I made a custom versioning strategy to replace the standard `version-mc_version` format (e.g., `1.0.0-1.18.2`).

I follow a **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format defined as follows:

### Major
**Example:** `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`
This is incremented when:
- Supporting a new Minecraft major version (e.g., updating from 1.7.10 to 1.12.2).
- Removing features or introducing breaking changes to the API.

<Callout type="warn" title="Breaking Changes">
  Major version increments usually indicate incompatible world saves. For example, a world created in `1.0.0` (Minecraft 1.7.10) may lose blocks or items if loaded in `2.0.0` (Minecraft 1.12.2).
</Callout>

### Minor
**Example:** `1.1.0` to `1.2.0`
This is incremented when:
- New features are added.
- Existing functionality is expanded without removing old features.

### Patch
**Example:** `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`
This is incremented when:
- Bugs are fixed.
- Performance improvements or internal refactoring occurs.
